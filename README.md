# Azure-Fundamentals- Microsoft Azure is a cloud service provider
# Basic terms in Azure.
**Cloud Computing:**
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. 
Benefit- 
Cost effective
Global
Secure
**Key concepts**
#scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
#elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
#agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
#fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
#disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
#high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)


**Common Cloud Services**
1. Infrastructures as a service (Iaas)- run application, program, coding. Focus on compute, storage, networking and databases. ex- Azure, AWS
2. Software as a service (SaaS)- doesnot know how service works. ex- Gmail, office 365
3. Platform as a Service (Paas)- Focus on the developement and management. ex- Heroku


**CapEx vs OpEx**
Differences between Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure

                      Capital Expenditure	      Operational Expenditure
Up front cost	            Significant	            None
Ongoing cost	              Low                 	Based on usage
Tax Deduction	          Over time	                Same year
Early Termination       	No	                    Anytime
Maintenance	            Significant	                Low
Value over time	        Lowers	                  No change

**consumption-based model**
The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage.

**Cloud Deployment Model**
Cloud Deployment Model is simple a separation which describes where are the company resources deployed. Whenever this is in public cloud provider environment or private datacenter.
3 layers are there- Public, Hybrid and private.
**Public Cloud**

Key Characteristics

Everything runs on cloud provider hardware
No local hardware
Some services share hardware with other customers

Advantages
No CapEx (No initial investment)
High Availability
Agility
Pay as you Go (PAYG) pricing
No hardware maintenance
No deep technical skills required

Disadvantages
Not all security and compliance policies can be met
No ownership over the physical infrastructure
Rare specific scenarios can’t be done

**Private Cloud**
Cloud Provider	Own Datacenter
✖	✅
Key Characteristics

Everything runs on your own datacenter
Self-service should be provided
You maintain the hardware
Advantages

Can support any scenario
Total control over security and infrastructure
Can meet any security and compliance policy
Disadvantages

Initial investment is required (CapEx)
Limited agility constrained by server capacity and team skills
Very dependent on IT skills & expertise
**Hybrid Cloud**
Cloud Provider	Own Datacenter
✅	✅
Key Characteristics

Combines both Public & Private cloud
Advantages

Great flexibility
You can run any legacy apps in private cloud
Can utilize existing infrastructure
Meet any security& compliance requirements
Can take advantage of all public cloud benefits
Disadvantages

Can be more expensive
Complicated to manage due to larger landscape
Most dependent on IT skills & expertise from all three models
